- DNS-based service discovery (aka DNS-SD) is a method of using a standard set
  of DNS records to describe network services so that they may be discovered by
  clients. DNS-SD is defined in [RFC 6763].

- Multicast DNS (aka mDNS) provides a way to respond to DNS queries without the
  need for a centralised DNS server. mDNS is defined in [RFC 6762].

- The combination of these two technologies, wherein a multicast DNS server
  answers DNS-SD queries gives us Zero Configuration networking, commonly known
  as Zeroconf or Bonjour.

## Goals

- Advertise and discover services via Zeroconf/Bonjour
- Discover DNS-SD services via conventional unicast DNS
- Advertise DNS-SD services via common unicast DNS services (Route53, etc)
- Expose methods for writing custom mDNS responders
- Allow mDNS queries without CGO
